This package uses GitHub workflows for automated tests, reviewable.io for code reviews. We strongly recommend setting up ``pre-commit`` so that the basic style and formatting checks run as part of your ``git commit`` hooks.

Releases
========

Netconan has not yet released a 1.0.0 release, so we are using alpha releases in the 0.xx.yy series. The version number is stored in ``netconan/__init__.py``. On the master branch, it is always ``0.<next-minor>.0.dev``, while in release branches we remove the ``.dev``.

Release branches
---------------

All releases are cut from release branches named ``release-0.xx`` branch. Note that we do not include the ``.yy`` extension for the ``patch`` version in the branch name. Instead, the same branch contains a series of commits corresponding to the patches.

Suppose that the latest release was ``v0.12.3``. That means that in the master branch, the version is listed as ``0.13.0.dev`` and the next minor release will be ``v0.13.0``.

1. To create the branch, run ``git checkout -b release-0.13``.
2. Modify ``netconan/__init__.py`` and update the version to ``0.13.0`` (remove the ``.dev``).
3. Commit the version change and push the branch to GitHub.
4. Go back to the master branch, and bump the minor version to ``0.14.0.dev``.

Building a release
-----------------

1. Create a clean virtual environment of the lowest supported Python version (e.g., 3.9).
2. Check out the release branch and ensure the version number has been updated (no ``.dev`` extension, accurate minor and patch versions).
3. Run ``pip install --upgrade pip wheel build twine`` in order to get the needed release packages.
4. Run ``python -m build`` to build the release.
5. Run ``twine check dist/*`` to check the built artifacts.
6. Run ``twine upload dist/*`` to upload the built artifacts to pypi.
7. Use GitHub releases to draft a new version: tag ``v0.13.0`` and title ``Netconan 0.13.0``. Populate release notes according to recent style and your discretion. Take especial care to acknowledge new or external open source contributions.

Building a release with GitHub Actions
-------------------------------------

1. Create a clean release branch following the steps above.
2. Ensure the version number in `netconan/__init__.py` has been updated (no `.dev` extension).
3. Push the branch to GitHub.
4. Go to the GitHub repository and navigate to the "Actions" tab.
5. Select the "Publish Python Package" workflow.
6. Click "Run workflow" and select the release branch.
7. Choose the target repository (pypi or testpypi).
8. Click "Run workflow".
9. Once the workflow completes successfully, the package will be published to the selected repository.
10. Create a GitHub release as described above (for PyPI releases only).

Testing with TestPyPI
--------------------

Before publishing a package to the main PyPI repository, it's recommended to test it with TestPyPI:

1. Follow the steps above for building a release with GitHub Actions, but select "testpypi" as the target repository.
2. Once published to TestPyPI, you can install the package using:
   ```
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ netconan
   ```
3. Verify that the package installs correctly and functions as expected.
4. If everything works as expected, run the workflow again but select "pypi" as the target repository.
