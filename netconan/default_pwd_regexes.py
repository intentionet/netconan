# Regexes taken from RANCID password scrubbing
#
# Multiple regexes in a single inner list will all be run before returning
# the anonymized line.  This is useful for config lines that may have multiple
# sensitive items (e.g. snmp-server auth password and priv password).
#
# Format for these tuples are:
#  1. sensitive line regex
#       note that the regexes use a named `prefix` group and lookaheads so we
#       can easily extract and replace just the sensitive information; whatever
#       text matches the `prefix` group is kept in the anonymized line
#  2. sensitive item regex-match-index
#       note that if this is None, any matching config line will be removed
#
# TODO(https://github.com/intentionet/netconan/issues/107)
# Some of these regexes need to be updated to support quote enclosed passwords
# which is allowed for at least some syntax on Juniper devices
