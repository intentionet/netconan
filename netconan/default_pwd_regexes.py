# Regexes taken from RANCID password scrubbing
#
# Multiple regexes in a single inner list will all be run before returning
# the anonymized line.  This is useful for config lines that may have multiple
# sensitive items (e.g. snmp-server auth password and priv password).
#
# Format for these tuples are:
#  1. sensitive line regex
#       note that the regexes use lookbehinds and lookaheads so we can easily
#       extract and replace just the sensitive information
#  2. sensitive item regex-match-index
#       note that if this is None, any matching config line will be removed
